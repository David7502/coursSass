//BE CAREFUL: @import method will be deprecated, but you can see it on some olds projets

//If you have variables, settings must be delcared first
@import "./settings";
@import "./layout/footer";
@import "./layout/header";
@import "./layout/navbar";
@import "./layout/section";

//NEW Method is usable with Dart Sass only and uses @use
//Not an issue at this stage as Sass is only used in development mode. The only file used in production is the CSS file
